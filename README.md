# Algorithms

I'm creating this repository of algorithms as a practice exercise. In real-life, I don't use the algorithms very often and had found
that I had forgotten how to create some of these from scratch. 

As a practice exercise, I am recreating a variety of sorting and searching algorithms. These will range from something like a bubble
sort that a first year CS student might create to something a bit more fun like a Bloom Filter (one of my favorites by the way). 

I'll probably include a bit twiddling project also. 

This is a fairly open ended endeavor and as long as there is an algorithm I'm interested in implementing, it might end up here.
